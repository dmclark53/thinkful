# Predicting Freight Value

In this project, I will investigate what factors affect the freight value for freight that is transported within the 
United States. I have taken a dataset from the [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.bts.gov), which is 
part of the [US Department of Transportation](https://www.transportation.gov). The dataset will only consider data for 
the year of 2017. Features in the dataset include: the mode of transportation, the origin and destination, the 
commodity type, the trade type, the weight, the value, and the distance traveled.

## Files Included
* **Predicting_freight_value-Data_Cleaning.ipynb:** Notebook dedicated to loading the raw dataset and cleaning it to
 prepare it for modeling.
* **Predicting_freight_value-Modeling:** Notebook dedicated to data exploration, feature engineering, and modeling.
* **helpers.py**: A script storing custom functions used by both Jupyter notebooks.
