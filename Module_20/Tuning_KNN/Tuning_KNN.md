# Tuning KNN

Let's say we work at a credit card company and we're trying to figure out if people are going to pay their bills on 
time. We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and 
entertainment. What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model? What aspects of KNN would be useful? Write up 
your thoughts in submit a link below.

**Answer:**
* target: 
    * bills paid on time
* features:
    * groceries
    * dining out
    * utilities
    * entertainment
* All features are continous.
* Plan:
    * Use KNN to model what purchase amounts in each category contributed most to bills not being paid on time
* KNNs are useful as they could group purchases made across many different categories to determine what combinations
of purchases contribute most to late payments.
