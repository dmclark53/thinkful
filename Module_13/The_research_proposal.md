# The Research Proposal

## Fitness Tracker App

### Problem:
* People in the community aren't very active.

### Hypothesis:
* Creating a fitness app can improve activity levels in the community.

### Test:
1. Gather data on current activity levels for community members.
2. Create a fitness tracker app and release it to the community.
3. Take a random sample of community members. This sample should include:
    * 50% of people using the app.
    * 50% of people not using the app.
    * Well sampled across demographic areas (age, sex, race, etc.)
4. Gather activity level data across full sample for one month.
    * If there is a 10% increase in activity level for people with the app, conclude that the fitness tracker app is 
    effective in improving activity levels in the community.
    * If the activity level increase is less than one stardard deviation, then continue the experiment for an 
    additional month.
    * If there is no change in activity level for either group, then conclude activity tracker app is not effective.
    
### Possible Conclusions:
1. The activity tracker app is effective.
2. The activity tracker could be effective, but more data is needed.
3. The activity tracker is not effective.
