# Bias and A/A testing

### You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May.

**Test:** How does email advertising affect bathing suite sales?

* This experiment is biased by time-of-year. More people are more likely to buy swim suits in May because it is warmer
rather than because of the ad.

### You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.

**Test:** Does openning a new anxiety clinic reduce anxiety in the general population?

* The specialty of this clinic will attract people with high anxiety and so will be biased towards this group.

### You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.

**Test:** Will website visits increase after using a new ad campaign?

* The results could be biased because the experiment was not run long enough. To reduce this bias, more data should be
acquired over a longer period of time.

### You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.

**Test:** Will website visits increase after creating a new loyalty program?

* This test suffers from the same bias as the previous test. One week may not be enough time to see the full
effects of a new loyalty program.
