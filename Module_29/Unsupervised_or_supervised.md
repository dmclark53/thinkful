# Unsupervised or supervised?

1. Define the likelihood that an individual will contract a specific disease.

    Supervised learning: The outcome is the likelihood of contracting a disease.

2. Translate a set of images into variables for modeling.

    Unsupervised learning: There is no outcome. A clustering algorithm could be used to group the images.

3. An ecommerce company wants to identify power users.

    Supervised learning: The outcome is power user. The model would predict with the user is a power user or not.

4. That same company wants to see shopping patterns in users.

    Unsupervised learning: Group users depending on their shopping patterns. These groups could be used for modeling
     with the user is a power user or not.

5. You want to reduce the number of variables inputting into your random forest model.

    Unsupervised learning: This is more like feature engineering, but could fall under the category of unsupervised
     learning. I would use PCA here to reduce the dimensions (number of variables) in this dataset.
